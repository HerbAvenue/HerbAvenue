Hey! My name is Chris and I'm currently building a coding portfolio to enter into the software/web development field.

- 🔭 Projects im currently working on are:
   - License/Membership Expiry Tracker [License.Petti.Dev](https://license.petti.dev/)
   - Typescript Deck of Cards Simulator [Cards.Petti.Dev](https://cards.petti.dev/)
   - "Ethereal Clouds" Weather Tracker (Link soon)

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, JavaScript/Typescript, and Flask for web applications. Will soon be studying GoDot for game development.

Feel free to send comments/tips/suggestions to me at chris@petti.dev 😄
